            I enhance a lot of what I have posted to be even more easily linkable for you such as by having new # links that make it more like a Wiki, this majorly enhances blogs due to the fact you can link even longer blogs with little to no issue. I still have yet to figure out spoiler boxes unforunately, that will just have to wait to be solved as I can't think of a solution yet.
