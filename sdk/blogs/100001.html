            1. I ended up making the DS Lite Browser blog. <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101015">Click here</a> (<a href="/sdk/blogs/101015.html">website version</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231124224229/https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=101015">archive</a>). It was a very basic blog, but it was a blog on the OG DS browser nonetheless.
            <br><br>
            2. Note to self: Please for fucks sake actually be faster and more frequent when creating blogs. Because of your laziness bitch, I couldn't be the owner of the 100,000th blog >:(<br>
            Ok but seriously, congrats on taking the 100,000th blog <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=100000">@cdog3789</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230904032715/https://3dspaint.com/blog/view.php?id=100000">archive</a>) on Paint, you did a great job :D
